# generator-gulpfile [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/rogeriopvl/generator-gulpfile.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rogeriopvl/generator-gulpfile)

A Gulpfile generator for [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io).


## Info

This generator creates a `Gulpfile.js` file, currently based on the type of project you are building (web or node).

`generator-gulpfile` is being improved to have more features. If you think that it should include more tasks by default, I'll gladly accept a pull request or an issue :)

### Install

To install generator-gulpfile from npm, run:

```
$ npm install -g generator-gulpfile
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```
$ yo gulpfile
```

### Features

* Choose between node or browser app project
* Node app includes tasks for jshint and mocha (more to come)
* Browser app includes tasks for jshint, watch, local http server, livereload (more to come)
